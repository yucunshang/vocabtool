# CRITICAL (Do not skip)

- Field 3: exactly 2 example sentences. Separated by ` // `.

# Input Data
altruism, hectic, retrospect

# Output Format Guidelines

2. **Layout**: One entry per line.

   `Target Word` ||| `Chinese Definition` ||| `2 Example Sentences`

# Field Constraints (Strict)
1. **Field 1: Word**
   - Output the target word itself (lowercase).
   - Do NOT add extra words or phrases.

2. **Field 2: Definition (涓枃)**
   - Simplified Chinese only. Prefer a SINGLE word or 2-4 characters (e.g. 鍒╀粬銆佸繖涔?. Avoid long phrases.

3. **Field 3: Examples (2 sentences, each with Chinese translation)**
   - TWO short, authentic English sentences separated by ` // `.
   - Each segment MUST be: `English sentence (涓枃缈昏瘧)` 鈥?same line, parentheses with Chinese.
   - Each English sentence must contain the target word/phrase.
